Things i struggled with during this project:
1. My main struggle was with functionality of the program. The biggest thing i learned was to start off the program very simple and to console.log often. Originally i began working with 30 questions and switched over to just 5.

Future Updates:
1. Turn the trivia game into a jeopardy trivia game.
2. Introduce levels of difficulty, each level is worth a x amount of points if the user gets the correct answer.
    i.e easy questions worth one point, medium = 2 points, hard = 3 points
3. Add a timer so the user only gets a minute per question.
    - this would also require the questions to show up one at a time
4. Expand on my questions, have them all in an array and create a function that chooses one randomly which once answered then gets pushed out of the array. This would ensure the user never gets the same question more than once and they don't know the order of questions.
    - as the user i would enjoy the element of unknown a lot more in a trivia game.
5. Work on my styling.
